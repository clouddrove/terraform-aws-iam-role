We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 
- [Terraform 1.5.4](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-iam-role/releases).


### Simple example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
      module "iam-role" {
      source              = "clouddrove/iam-role/aws"
      version             = "1.3.0"

      name                = "iam-role"
      application         = "clouddrove"
      environment         = "test"
      label_order         = ["environment", "name"]
      assume_role_policy  = data.aws_iam_policy_document.default.json
      managed_policy_arns = 
      policy_enabled      = true
      policy              = data.aws_iam_policy_document.iam-policy.json
    }

      data "aws_iam_policy_document" "default" {
      statement {
      effect  = "Allow"
      actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]
      principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["ec2.amazonaws.com"]
      }
      }
    }

      data "aws_iam_policy_document" "iam-policy" {
      statement {
      actions = [
      "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation",
      "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel",
      "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
      "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
      "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel"    ]
      effect    = "Allow"
      resources = ["*"]
      }
    }
```

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the role. |
| name | Name of specifying the role. |
| policy | The policy document attached to the role. |
| role | The name of the role associated with the policy. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
